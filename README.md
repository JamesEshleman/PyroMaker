# PyroMaker
# PyroMaker was written by Dr. Matthew Olson to generate pyrosequencing traces when a given DNA sequence is entered, and a dispensation order is also provided.
# It is for research use only and is intended as a teaching tool and also to solve difficult pryosequencing traces.
# It is described in better detail in the folowing publication: Methods Mol Biol. 2015:1315:29-38. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-2715-9_3.  PMID: 26103889
